# Fingsics

Fingsics is a rigid-body collision detection engine developed by Thomas Wallace and Santiago Goycoechea as their thesis project for the Software Engineer degree.

Using Fingiscs scenes containing thousands of bodies can be played in real time, as well as be recorded for future playback, both in video format as well as a format defined and used by Fingsics.

With respect to collision handling, the engine provides the posibility to choose from many different collision detection algorithms that benefit from the use of bounding volumes (one of them being Sweep-And-Prune), and its collision response algorithm is implemented with an impulse-based approach.

To run Fingsics yourself, download the files in the _binaries_ folder and follow the instructions in the User Manual located inside the _docs_ folder.
